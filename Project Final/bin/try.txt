The Great Gatsby may be the most popular classic in 
modern American fiction.
Since its publication in 1925, 
Fitzgerald's masterpiece has become 
a touchstone for generations of readers
and writers, many of whom reread it every 


ew years as a ritual of imaginative renewal. 
The story of Jay Gatsby's desperate quest to
win back his first love reverberates with themes 

at once characteristically American and universally
human, among them the importance of honesty, the
temptations of wealth, and the struggle to escape 
the past. Though The Great Gatsby runs to fewer than 
two hundred pages, there is no bigger read in American literature.
