If you can keep your head when all about you Are losing theirs and blaming it on
  If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you, But make allowance for their
too; If you can wait and not be tired by waiting, Or being lied about, dont deal
  lies, Or being hated, dont give way to hating, And yet dont look too good, nor
too wise: If you can dream and not make dreams your master; If you can think and
     make thoughts your aim; If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster And treat
     two impostors just the same; If you can bear to hear the truth youve spoken
  by knaves to make a trap for fools, Or watch the things you gave your life to,
  And stoop and build em up with worn-out tools: If you can make one heap of all
winnings And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss, And lose, and start again at
beginnings And never breathe a word about your loss; If you can force your heart
nerve and sinew To serve your turn long after they are gone, And so hold on when
  is nothing in you Except the Will which says to them: Hold on! If you can talk
   crowds and keep your virtue, Or walk with Kings nor lose the common touch, If
   foes nor loving friends can hurt you, If all men count with you, but none too
If you can fill the unforgiving minute With sixty seconds worth of distance run,
    is the Earth and everything thats in it, Andwhich is more youll be a Man, my
